## Webpage description:
<br>

### Purpose:

The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS and website design as well as display attributes and information about me. 

The target audience is for a potential employer.
<br>
<br>

### Functionality / features:

The website contains features that provide the feeling of responsiveness.
To create this feeling, I have created hover animations on the following


The logo features as the home page button. From anywhere on the website you can click this to go back to the main page.
The logo is at 75% opacity and changes to 90% opacity when the user hover's their cursor over it to create a responsive feel.

Navigation is comprised of the logo (left hand side) and three buttons (right hand side) These combine to give the user full access to all pages of the website. The navigation buttons respond to mouse hover to create a responsive feel. They also change orientation from horizontal to vertical when used on a mobile device.

Page banners are used to navigate within the About me and Blog pages. 
On both pages there are multiple entries for the user to read. Users can click on a banner and it will take them to the corresponding part of the webpage. On each blog entry, including the bottom of the page, there are buttons that take the user back to the top of the page to prevent excessive scrolling. When the user clicks on a banner or the 'back to top' button, a scrolling animation occurs to provide a smooth and modern experience.

<br>
The banners change appearance on hover to create a responsive feel. They have 85% opacity and change to 100% opacity on over. They also slightly increase in size on hover. They take up the full width of the screen on mobile view but do not do so on desktop view. The banners have background images so as to provide a professional look.

All images on the webpage will increase in size on hover to create a responsive feel. Some images also increase in opacity on hover such as the example below:
